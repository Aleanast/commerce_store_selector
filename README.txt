INTRODUCTION
------------

This module implements a simple form in a block for switching the current store.

It works by setting a cookie with the current store in the current session.

Both anonymous and authenticated users are supported when setting the cookie.

It requires Commerce 2.x, at least Drupal 8.3.x and multiple Commerce stores.


INSTALLATION
------------

Installation is like any other module, just place the files in the modules
directory and enable the module on the 'Extend' page.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Add the block via the block layout page to any region you like.
